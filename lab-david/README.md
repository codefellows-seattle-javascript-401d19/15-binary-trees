## Binary Tree - Day 15
This is a binary tree data structure demonstration that uses a constructor to create new binary trees. The constructor includes three prototype methods that traverse the trees. 

## Motivation
I was motivated by an extreme desire to learn web development which led me to enroll in this program which ultimately led me to this assignment. 

## Language
Javascript

## Dependencies necessary 
### for production: 
- none
### for development: 
- eslint
- jest

## Features
The constructor should create new binary trees and the prototype methods should do the following: 
- `find(value)` : should iterate over all the child nodes using *in-order traversal* and return the first node given `value` value.
- `toString(str)` : should iterate over all the child nodes using *pre-order traversal* and concatenate their values into a string separated by new lines. 
- `toArray(array)` : should iterate over all the child nodes using *post-order traversal* and push all the tree's elements into an array.


## Installation / How to use
- clone this repo to your machine
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- run `npm test` to run tests

## Tests
Test should test the following: 
- find prototype should iterate over all the child nodes using 'in-order' traversal and return the first node value that has a value
- find prototype should iterate over all the child nodes using 'in-order' traversal and return null if a node with a value is not found | edge case
- toString prototype should iterate over all the child nodes using 'pre-order' traversal and concatenate their values into a string separated by newlines
- toString prototype should iterate over all the child nodes using 'pre-order' traversal and return null if not given a thing | edge case
- toArray method should iterate over all the child nodes using 'post-order' traversal and push all the trees elements into an array (1ms)
- toArray method should iterate over all the child nodes using 'post-order' traversal and push all the trees elements into an array | edge case
